# Multi-chain RAI

## Fantom

Currently, RAI holders can port their tokens to [Fantom RAI](https://ftmscan.com/token/0xa71353bb71dda105d383b02fc2dd172c4d39ef8b) using the [Multichain.xyz](https://multichain.xyz/) bridge. RAI holders should keep in mind that they need to get FTM first in order to send transactions on Fantom. One way to [get FTM](https://fantom.foundation/where-to-buy-ftm/) is on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) and then use Multichain.xyz to transfer your Ethereum FTM to Fantom FTM.

Once you have FTM and RAI on the Fantom chain, you should also make sure you have [Fantom set up](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask) in Metamask \(or any other wallet you're using\).

The RAI address on Fantom can be found [here](https://ftmscan.com/token/0xa71353bb71dda105d383b02fc2dd172c4d39ef8b).

### RAI Partners

The first protocol that started to support RAI on Fantom is [SpiritSwap](https://app.spiritswap.finance/#/). Initially, SpiritSwap will incentivize RAI/FTM LPs using their SPIRIT token.

In order to earn SPIRIT, you need to LP in the [RAI/FTM pool](https://swap.spiritswap.finance/#/add/FTM/0xa71353Bb71DdA105D383B02fc2dD172C4D39eF8B) and then go the the [staking page](https://app.spiritswap.finance/#/farms) and find the the RAI/FTM farm \(by typing "RAI" in the Search field\).
