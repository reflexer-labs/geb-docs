* `getCallerReward() public view returns (uint256 reward)` - get the actual reward that can be pulled from the SF treasury by taking the minimum value between the `fixedReward`and the total amount that can be sent by the `treasury` in one block
* `rewardCaller(proposedFeeReceiver: address) internal` - internal function to send a SF reward to a fee receiver by calling the `treasury`

## 3. Walkthrough <a href="#2-contract-details" id="2-contract-details"></a>

`rewardCaller` is the most important function in this contract. It takes care of pulling a fixed SF reward from the treasury and then sending it to a `proposedFeeReceiver`.

`getCallerReward` can be used to retrieve the current SF fee that can be pulled from the treasury.
