# Stability Fee Treasury

## 1. Summary <a href="#1-introduction-summary" id="1-introduction-summary"></a>

The `StabilityFeeTreasury` is meant to allow other contracts or EOAs to pull funds (stability fees) in order to finance their operations. The treasury is set up as a `secondaryReceiver` in the `TaxCollector`. Anyone can periodically call the contract in order to recompute an optimal amount of fees that should be kept in the treasury and send any additional surplus to the `extraSurplusReceiver`.

## 2. Contract Variables & Functions <a href="#2-contract-details" id="2-contract-details"></a>

**Variables**

* `authorizedAccounts[usr: address]` - `addAuthorization`/`removeAuthorization` - auth mechanisms
* `allowance[receiver: address]` - total withdrawal allowance
* `pulledPerBlock[usr: address`, `blockNr: uint256]` - total amount pulled by a user on a specific block
* `safeEngine` - address of the `SAFEEngine`
* `systemCoin` - system coin address ([Coin.sol](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/master/src/Coin.sol))
* `coinJoin` - system coin adapter address
* `extraSurplusReceiver` - address that receives extra unused funds from the treasury
* `treasuryCapacity` - maximum amount of stability fees should be kept in the treasury
* `minimumFundsRequired` - minimum amount of stability fees that must be kept in the treasury at all times
*   `expensesMultiplier` - multiplier for the expenses incurred since the last `transferSurplusFunds` call. Ensures there's a buffer of funds on top of the expected expenses until the next&#x20;

    `transferSurplusFunds` call
* `surplusTransferDelay` - delay between two `transferSurplusFunds` calls
* `expensesAccumulator` - total expenses incurred since treasury deployment
* `accumulatorTag` - latest snapshot of `expensesAccumulator`
* `latestSurplusTransferTime` - last timestamp when `transferSurplusFunds` was called
* `contractEnabled` - global settlement flag

**Data Structures**

* `Allowance` - struct that specifies the total and the per-block withdrawal allowance for an address. Contains:
  * `total` - the total allowance (in `RAD`)
  * `perBlock` - the per-block allowance (in `RAD`)

**Modifiers**

* `isAuthorized` - checks whether an address is part of `authorizedAddresses` (and thus can call authed functions).
* `accountNotTreasury` - checks that the receiver account for treasury funds is not the treasury itself

**Functions**

* `modifyParameters()` - authorized function for changing treasury parameters
* `disableContract()` - disable the treasury and transfer all of its funds to the`extraSurplusReceiver`
* `joinAllCoins()` - join any ERC20 system coins that the treasury has into internal coin form (`SAFEEngine.coinBalance`)
* `getAllowance(account: address)` - get the total and the per-block allowance for a user
* `setTotalAllowance(account: address`, `rad: uint256)` - authorized function that changes the total allowed amount an address can withdraw from the treasury
* `setPerBlockAllowance(account: address`, `rad: uint256)` - authorized function that changes the amount that an address can withdraw from the treasury every block
* `giveFunds(account: address`, `rad: uint256)` - governance controlled function that transfers stability fees from the treasury to a destination address
* `takeFunds(account: address`, `rad: uint256)` - governance controlled function that transfers stability fees from a target address to the treasury
* `pullFunds(dstAccount: address`, `token: address`, `wad: uint256)` - take funds from the treasury. Reverts if the caller is not allowed to withdraw or if their per-block allowance doesn't allow it
* `transferSurplusFunds()` - recalculate the amount of stability fees that should remain in the treasury and transfer additional funds to the `extraSurplusReceiver`

**Events**

* `AddAuthorization` - emitted when a new address becomes authorized. Contains:
  * `account` - the new authorized account
* `RemoveAuthorization` - emitted when an address is de-authorized. Contains:
  * `account` - the address that was de-authorized
* `ModifyParameters` - emitted when a parameter is updated.
* `DisableContract` - emitted when the contract is disabled.
* `SetTotalAllowance` - emitted when the total allowance for an address is set. Contains:
  * `account` - the account whose allowance was changed
  * `rad` - the new total allowance for the `account`
* `SetPerBlockAllowance` - emitted when the per-block allowance for an address is set. Contains:
  * `account` - the account whose per-block allowance was changed
  * `rad` - the new total allowance for the `account`
* `GiveFunds` - emitted when governance offers funds to an address. Contains:
  * `account` - the account that received funds
  * `rad` - the amount of funds that were given
  * `expensesAccumulator` - the sum of all the expenses incurred since the contract was deployed
* `TakeFunds` - emitted when governance calls the treasury to take funds from an address. Contains:
  * `account` - the account the treasury takes system coins from
  * `rad` - the amount of (internal) system coins to take (expressed as `RAD`)
* `PullFunds` - emitted when an approved address pulls funds from the treasury. Contains:
  * `sender` - the `msg.sender` that called `pullFunds`
  * `dstAccount` - the address that received funds
  * `token` - the address of the token being transferred (in this case it's always the address of the ERC20 system coin)
  * `rad` - the total amount of internal system coins transferred
  * `expensesAccumulator` - the sum of all the expenses incurred since the contract was deployed
* `TransferSurplusFunds` - emitted when surplus funds above the optimum amount are sent to the accounting engine. Contains:
  * `extraSurplusReceiver` - the address that received the extra funds
  * `fundsToTransfer` - the amount of funds sent

## 3. Walkthrough <a href="#2-contract-details" id="2-contract-details"></a>

The treasury is funded by stability fees coming from the `TaxCollector` or by anyone who is willing to send system coins (either internally or as ERC20 tokens) to it. Governance can also use `takeFunds` to transfer internal system coins from a source address to the treasury.\
\
Governance is in charge with setting up authorized addresses that can `pullFunds` out of the treasury (if their total or per-block `allowance` permits) as well as setting treasury parameters in order to determine the optimum amount of funds that should remain in the contract at any time. We define "optimum" as a multiplier (`expensesMultiplier`) of the latest expenses incurred by the treasury since the last `transferSurplusFunds` call.&#x20;

`transferSurplusFunds` is the way the treasury recalculates the amount of funds it should keep in reserves and transfers any surplus to the `extraSurplusReceiver`. Note that there is a `surplusTransferDelay` time delay between recalculating the optimum and transferring surplus out of the contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sending Funds to** `extraSurplusReceiver`**or to the Treasury Itself**

In case governance wants to send funds to `extraSurplusReceiver` using `giveFunds`, `expensesAccumulator` will not increase. In case an address wants to `pullFunds` and send them to the `extraSurplusReceiver`, `pullFunds` will revert.\
\
`pullFunds` will silently fail if the `dstAccount` is the treasury contract itself, whereas `giveFunds` will revert.
