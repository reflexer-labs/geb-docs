# English Collateral Auction House

## 1. Summary <a href="#1-introduction-summary" id="1-introduction-summary"></a>

English collateral auctions are used to sell collateral from SAFEs that have become undercollateralized in order to preserve the overall system health. The `LiquidationEngine` sends collateral to the `EnglishCollateralAuctionHouse` where it is auctioned in two phases: `increaseBidSize` and `decreaseSoldAmount`.

## 2. Contract Variables & Functions <a href="#2-contract-details" id="2-contract-details"></a>

**Variables**

* `contractEnabled` - settlement flag (`1` or `0`).
* `AUCTION_HOUSE_TYPE` - flag set to `bytes32("COLLATERAL")`
* `AUCTION_TYPE` - flag set to `bytes32("ENGLISH")`.
* `authorizedAccounts[usr: address]` - addresses allowed to call `modifyParameters()` and `disableContract()`.
* `safeEngine` - storage of the `SAFEEngine`'s address.
* `bids[id: uint]` - storage of all bids.
* `collateralType` - id of the collateral type for which the `CollateralAuctionHouse` is responsible.
* `bidIncrease` - minimum bid increase (default: 5%).
* `bidDuration` - bid duration (default: 3 hours).
* `totalAuctionLength` - auction length (default: 2 days).
* `auctionsStarted` - total auction count, used to track auction `id`s.
* `bidToMarketPriceRatio` - the minimum size of the first bid compared to the latest recorded collateral price (for `collateralType`) in the system.
* `oracleRelayer` - address of the `OracleRelayer`.
* `osm` - collateral type `OSM` address
* `liquidationEngine` - the address of the `LiquidationEngine`

**Data Structures**

* `Bid` - state of a specific auction
  * `bidAmount` - paid system coins
  * `amountToSell` - quantity up for auction / collateral for sale
  * `highBidder`
  * `bidExpiry` - when a bid expires (and the auction ends)
  * `auctionDeadline` - max auction duration
  * `forgoneCollateralReceiver` - address of the SAFE being auctioned. Receives collateral during the `decreaseSoldAmount` phase
  * `auctionIncomeRecipient` - recipient of auction income / receives system coin income (this is the `AccountingEngine` contract)
  * `amountToRaise` - total system coins wanted from the auction

**Modifiers**

* `isAuthorized` - checks whether an address is part of `authorizedAddresses` (and thus can call authed functions).

**Functions**

* `modifyParameters(bytes32 parameter`, `uint256 data)` - update a `uint256` parameter.
* `modifyParameters(bytes32 parameter`, `address data)` - update an `address` parameter.
* `addAuthorization(usr: address)` - add an address to `authorizedAddresses`.
* `removeAuthorization(usr: address)` - remove an address from `authorizedAddresses`.
* `startAuction(forgoneCollateralReceiver: address`, `auctionIncomeRecipient: address`, `amountToRaise: uint256`, `amountToSell: uint256`, `initialBid: uint256 )` - function used by `LiquidationEngine` to start an auction / put collateral up for auction
* `restartAuction(id: uint256)` - restart an auction if there have been 0 bids and the `auctionDeadline` has passed
* `increaseBidSize(id: uint256`, `amountToBuy: uint256`, `rad: uint256)` - first phase of an auction. Increasing system coin `bid`s for a set `amountToSell` of collateral
* `decreaseSoldAmount(id: uint256`, `amountToBuy: uint256`, `rad: uint256)` - second phase of an auction. Set system coin `bid` for a decreasing`amountToSell`of collateral.
* `settleAuction(id: uint256)` - claim a winning bid / settles a completed auction
* `terminateAuctionPrematurely(id: uint256)` - used during `GlobalSettlement` to terminate `increaseBidSize` phase auctions and transfer the collateral to the settlement contract while repaying system coins (the winning bid) to the highest bidder.
* `bidAmount(id: uint256) public view returns (uint256)` - return the latest `bidAmount` from a specific auction
* `remainingAmountToSell(id: uint256) public view returns (uint256)` - return the remaining collateral amount to sell from a specific auction
* `forgoneCollateralReceiver(uint id) public view returns (address)` - return the`forgoneCollateralReceiver` for a specific auction
* `raisedAmount(id: uint256)` - always returns zero
* `amountToRaise(uint id) public view returns (uint256)` - return the amount of system coins to raise for a specific auction

**Events**

* `AddAuthorization` - emitted when a new address becomes authorized. Contains:
  * `account` - the new authorized account
* `RemoveAuthorization` - emitted when an address is de-authorized. Contains:
  * `account` - the address that was de-authorized
* `StartAuction`- emitted when `startAuction(address`, `address`, `uint256`, `uint256`, `uint256)` is successfully executed. Contains:
  * `id` - auction id
  * `auctionsStarted` - total amount of auctions started up until now
  * `amountToSell` - amount of collateral sold in the auction
  * `initialBid` - starting bid for the auction (usually zero).
  * `amountToRaise` - amount of system coins that should be raised by the auction.
  * `forgoneCollateralReceiver` - receiver of leftover collateral (usually the SAFE whose collateral was confiscated by the `LiquidationEngine`).
  * `auctionIncomeRecipient` - receiver of system coins (usually the `AccountingEngine`)
  * `auctionDeadline` - the auction's deadline
* `ModifyParameters` - emitted when a parameter is updated
* `RestartAuction` - emitted when an auction restarts due to a lack of bids. Contains:
  * `id` - the ID of the auction to restart
  * `auctionDeadline` - the new deadline for the auction with the ID `id`
* `IncreaseBidSize` - emitted when a bidder offers more system coins for the same amount of collateral. Contains:
  * `id` - the id of the auction being bid on
  * `highBidder` - the new high bidder (new auction winner which is set to `msg.sender`)
  * `amountToBuy` - total amount of collateral being bought from the auction
  * `rad` - the new system coin bid
  * `bidExpiry` - the timestamp after which the new bid will be considered final and `highBidder` can receive the collateral (even if `bidExpiry` < `auctionDeadline`)
* `DecreaseSoldAmount` - emitted when someone accepts a smaller amount of collateral for the same amount of `rad` system coins bid in the `increaseBidSize` phase. Contains:
  * `id` - the id of the auction being bid on
  * `highBidder` - the new high bidder (new auction winner which is set to `msg.sender`)
  * `amountToBuy` - new (and lower) amount of collateral being bought from the auction
  * `rad` - same system coin bid as the winning bid from the&#x20;
  * `bidExpiry` - the timestamp after which the new bid will be considered final and `highBidder` can receive the collateral (even if `bidExpiry` < `auctionDeadline`)
* `SettleAuction` - emitted after an auction is settled. Contains:
  * `id` - the ID of the auction that has just been settled
* `TerminateAuctionPrematurely` - emitted after an auction is terminated prematurely by an authed address. Contains:
  * `id` - the ID of the auction being terminated
  * `sender` - `msg.sender`
  * `bidAmount` - the amount of system coins that should have been raised by the auction
  * `collateralAmount` - the total amount of collateral that should have been sold by the auction

## 3. Walkthrough <a href="#3-key-mechanisms-and-concepts" id="3-key-mechanisms-and-concepts"></a>

Starting in the `increaseBidSize`-phase, bidders compete for an `amountToSell` of collateral with increasing bid amounts of system coins. The very first `bidAmount` will need to be higher than or equal to `latest collateral price in collateral OSM * bidToMarketPriceRatio / RAY.` This ensures that no bidder can submit an extremely small `bidAmount` and thus pay a negligible price for the entire `amountToSell` collateral.&#x20;

Once `amountToRaise` amount of system coins has been raised, the auction moves to the `decreaseSoldAmount`-phase. This phase is meant to incentivize bidders to returns as much collateral as possible back to the SAFE while still paying `amountToRaise` system coins.

Once the auction's last bid has expired or the auction itself has reached the `auctionDeadline` anyone can call `settleAuction` to payout the highest bidder (`Bid.highBidder`). This moves collateral from the `CollateralAuctionHouse`'s balance in the `SAFEEngine` to the winning bidder's balance.

When the auction is settled (or terminated prematurely), the contract will call the `LiquidationEngine` in order to `removeCoinsFromAuction` (subtract `bids[auctionId].amountToRaise` from `LiquidationEngine.currentOnAuctionSystemCoins`).
