# Increasing Discount Collateral Auction House

## 1. Summary

Increasing discount collateral auctions are similar to fixed discount ones in that they are used to preserve the overall system health by liquidating under-collateralized SAFEs and selling off collateral at a discount. This auction type automatically calculates an amount of collateral to send back to a bidder, taking into account the amount of system coins the bidder submits as well as the current system coin `redemptionPrice` (and optionally its market price) and collateral market price.

## 2. Contract Variables & Functions <a href="#2-contract-details" id="2-contract-details"></a>

**Variables**

* `contractEnabled` - settlement flag (`1` or `0`).
* `AUCTION_HOUSE_TYPE` - flag set to `bytes32("COLLATERAL")`

## 3. Walkthrough <a href="#3-key-mechanisms-and-concepts" id="3-key-mechanisms-and-concepts"></a>

The bidding process in an increasing discount auction is almost identical to the one in fixed discount auctions.

The only difference is that increasing discount auctions start with a smaller discount which increases at a pace of `perSecondDiscountUpdateRate` per second. The discount will increase until it hits`maxDiscount` or until  `discountIncreaseDeadline` passes.

## 4. Gotchas

Increasing discount auctions have the same gotchas as fixed discount ones.
